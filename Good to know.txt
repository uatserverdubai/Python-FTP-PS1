To transfer files from one workstation to another using FTP via PowerShell (.ps1 script), you can use Python as the FTP server on one machine and PowerShell as the client on the other.

Here‚Äôs how to set it up:

‚úÖ Step 1: Set Up an FTP Server Using Python (on the "sending" machine)
If you're transferring from Workstation A to Workstation B, then A will act as an FTP server.

üêç Python Script (FTP server):
Install pyftpdlib (only once):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyftpdlib
Then create a file called ftp_server.py with the following content:

python
Copy
Edit
from pyftpdlib.authorizers import DummyAuthorizer
from pyftpdlib.handlers import FTPHandler
from pyftpdlib.servers import FTPServer

authorizer = DummyAuthorizer()
authorizer.add_user("blondel", "password123", ".", perm="elradfmw")  # '.' means current dir

handler = FTPHandler
handler.authorizer = authorizer

server = FTPServer(("0.0.0.0", 21), handler)
server.serve_forever()
Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python ftp_server.py
üí° This starts a basic FTP server using user blondel and password password123.

‚úÖ Step 2: Use PowerShell to Transfer File (on "receiving" machine)
Create a PowerShell script, e.g. ftp_transfer.ps1:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$ftp = "ftp://192.168.1.100/samplefile.txt"     # IP of FTP server (Workstation A)
$user = "blondel"
$pass = "password123"
$target = "C:\Users\Public\samplefile.txt"      # Destination path on Workstation B

$webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$webclient.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential($user, $pass)
$webclient.DownloadFile($ftp, $target)
Replace:

192.168.1.100 ‚Üí with the IP of Workstation A

samplefile.txt ‚Üí the file you want to download

Destination path as needed

Then run the script on Workstation B:

powershell
Copy
Edit
.\ftp_transfer.ps1
üîí Optional: Upload from PowerShell instead
To send a file to the FTP server from PowerShell:

powershell
Copy
Edit
$ftp = "ftp://192.168.1.100/uploaded.txt"
$user = "blondel"
$pass = "password123"
$source = "C:\Users\Public\myfile.txt"

$webclient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$webclient.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential($user, $pass)
$webclient.UploadFile($ftp, $source)
